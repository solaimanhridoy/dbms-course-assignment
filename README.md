We were assigned this assignment to collect data for the Super-shop Management System and make tables for them. As the course teacher asked for the real product data and had to be a large number of data set, I built a simple python web scrapping script to crawl the data from a web site called chaldal.com 

Here are three script: 

ProductTable.py : This is the actual script where I wrote the web scrapping code to collect real product data from the website chaldal.com

OtherData.py : It contains code to generate other data card_details, payment_id, payment_customer_id etc.

payment.py : This script is for generating payment data where I used some simple logics to write the code to implement realistic payment data.

To run these scripts simply type from the commandline: 

```
python3 filename.py
```
